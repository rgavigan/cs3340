# CS 3340: Algorithms
## Assignment 1: Creating Fibonacci Algorithms
Generated Fibonacci numbers in O(n) speed using matrix multiplication. Created personal data structure using integer arrays to hold values larger than possible through a simple Java primitive type. Calculated N(500) for this modified factorial function in ~0.1 seconds.

## Assignment 2: Binary Image Union Find Algorithm
Generated a union find on connected components in a binary image. Found all connected components and displayed the binary image's connected components in multiple ways based on set ranks. Discovered how many connected components there were and their sizes. Works for any binary images containing 0's and 1's.
